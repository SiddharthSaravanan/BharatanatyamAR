# BharatanatyamAR
Composition and Rendering of Bharatanatyam Performance in Augmented Reality

Project1OnAesthetics.pdf is the relevant chapter from the thesis written by Sangeetha Jadhav from goa university
which motivated this project.

the code is a crude animation example based on the 30-dimensional vector notation used in the thesis.

I have used Blender's Python API to take a sequence of 30-dimensional vectors and create a 3d animation of a
human model performing the dance encoded by the sequence of vectors. The blend file containing the model and
the python code which creates the animation can be found here:

The python code in the folder "blender_3danimation", is the code used within blender to create the animation.
inputanim.txt is a sequence of space-separated 30-dimensional vectors used to create the animation.
The folder also contains videos of the rendered animation/dance corresponding to the sequence of
vector inputs given in the inputanim txt file.
